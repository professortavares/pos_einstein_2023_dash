## Prompt 01

### Question:

I would like to create a project in streamlit (python) for an mvp of a machine learning application. what is the file structure should i build?

### Answer:

Creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using Streamlit for a machine learning application is a great way to get quick feedback and visualize your model's performance. Below is a suggested file structure for your Streamlit MVP:

```
my_ml_app/
|-- .gitignore
|-- README.md
|-- requirements.txt
|-- app.py
|-- data/
|   |-- raw_data.csv
|   |-- processed_data.csv
|-- models/
|   |-- trained_model.pkl
|-- scripts/
|   |-- data_preprocessing.py
|   |-- model_training.py
|   |-- utilities.py
|-- static/
|   |-- images/
|       |-- logo.png
|-- notebooks/
|   |-- exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb
```

Explanation:

1. **.gitignore**: List files and directories that you want Git to ignore.

2. **README.md**: Describe your project, its purpose, how to run it, and any other necessary documentation.

3. **requirements.txt**: List all the Python libraries required for your project.

4. **app.py**: This is your main Streamlit application file where you'll import and use your machine learning models, visualize data, and build the UI/UX.

5. **data/**: Store datasets. You can have raw data and any pre-processed or intermediary data files.

6. **models/**: Store saved models, like pickled models or Tensorflow/Keras models.

7. **scripts/**: 
   - **data_preprocessing.py**: Include functions to clean and preprocess the data.
   - **model_training.py**: Logic for training your machine learning model.
   - **utilities.py**: Any utility functions that can be used across your project.

8. **static/**:
   - **images/**: If you want to display images, logos, etc., in your Streamlit app.

9. **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks are great for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prototyping. This directory can store those notebooks.

To set up and run your MVP:

1. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install necessary libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run your Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

This file structure provides a modular and organized approach. As your MVP evolves, you can modularize even further, separate out the logic more granularly, or add more directories for features like logging, monitoring, etc.


## Prompt 02

### Question:

how can I ignore venv folder from git?

### Answer:

To ignore the `venv` folder (or any other folder or file) from Git, you can add it to the `.gitignore` file in your project directory.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to your project root directory.
2. Open (or create) the `.gitignore` file in a text editor.
3. Add the following line to the `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   venv/
   ```
4. Save and close the `.gitignore` file.
5. Commit the changes to your Git repository:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Added venv to .gitignore"
   ```

Now, the `venv` directory will be ignored by Git and won't be tracked or included in commits. 

Remember, if you had previously added the `venv` directory to your Git repository before adding it to `.gitignore`, you'll need to remove it from the repository. You can do this using:
```bash
git rm -r --cached venv/
git commit -m "Removed venv from tracking"
```
The `--cached` option will untrack the folder but also keep it in your local workspace.

## Prompt 03

### Question:

i am using streamlit, pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib and shap in my project. how should i build the requirements file? I want everyone to be on the latest available version

### Answer:

If you want everyone to be on the latest available version of each library, you can specify the libraries without versions in your `requirements.txt` file. However, do note that this comes with its own risks: if any of these libraries release a breaking change in the future, your project might stop working as expected. It's generally a good practice to pin versions to ensure stability, but if you're sure about always using the latest, then you can go ahead.

Here's how your `requirements.txt` should look:

```
streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
shape
```

To create this `requirements.txt` automatically, you can use:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

However, this will pin the current versions of all your installed packages, so you'll have to edit the file and remove the version pins if you want to use the latest available versions.

If you decide later that you want to pin your packages to the current latest versions to avoid unexpected breaks, you can update the `requirements.txt` like this:

```bash
streamlit==0.x.x
pandas==1.x.x
scikit-learn==0.y.y
seaborn==0.z.z
matplotlib==3.a.a
shapely==1.b.b
```

Replace `x.x.x`, `y.y`, `z.z`, `a.a`, and `b.b` with the appropriate version numbers.

## Prompt 04

### Question:

Right! Now I would like to know if the streamlit is working. Which command should I run?

### Answer:

To check if Streamlit is working correctly after installing it, you can run one of its demo applications.

Use the following command:

```bash
streamlit hello
```

When you run this command, Streamlit should open a new page in your default web browser with an interactive demo application. If you see this application and can interact with it, Streamlit is working correctly on your machine.

To run your own Streamlit applications, you'll use:

```bash
streamlit run your_app_filename.py
```

Replace `your_app_filename.py` with the path to your Streamlit script.


## Prompt 05

### Question:

excellent! now i need you to build the streamlit screen. I will inform you the input fields:

- 'BMI': numerical variable (float) that has the range (minimum value 12, maximum 98'
- 'PhysHlth': numeric variable (integer) that is in the range (minimum value 0, maximum 30)
- 'HighBP': logical variable (boolean)
- 'HighChol': logical variable (boolean)
- 'GenHlth': variable in which there must be a choice between values (fair, poor or good). user can choose 1 of these choices or none
- 'DiffWalk': logical variable (boolean)
- 'Income > 75k': logical variable (boolean)

### Answer:

Here's a basic structure for your Streamlit application with the specified input fields:

```python
import streamlit as st

def main():
    st.title("Machine Learning Application")

    # Collecting inputs from the user
    st.sidebar.header("User Input Parameters")

    # BMI input
    bmi = st.sidebar.slider("BMI", min_value=12.0, max_value=98.0, value=25.0, step=0.1)

    # PhysHlth input
    phys_hlth = st.sidebar.slider("PhysHlth", min_value=0, max_value=30, value=15, step=1)

    # HighBP input
    high_bp = st.sidebar.checkbox("HighBP")

    # HighChol input
    high_chol = st.sidebar.checkbox("HighChol")

    # GenHlth input
    gen_hlth_options = ['fair', 'poor', 'good', 'None']
    gen_hlth = st.sidebar.selectbox("GenHlth", options=gen_hlth_options, index=3)
    if gen_hlth == 'None':
        gen_hlth = None

    # DiffWalk input
    diff_walk = st.sidebar.checkbox("DiffWalk")

    # Income input
    income = st.sidebar.checkbox("Income > 75k")

    st.write("### User Input parameters")
    st.write(f"BMI: {bmi}")
    st.write(f"PhysHlth: {phys_hlth}")
    st.write(f"HighBP: {high_bp}")
    st.write(f"HighChol: {high_chol}")
    st.write(f"GenHlth: {gen_hlth}")
    st.write(f"DiffWalk: {diff_walk}")
    st.write(f"Income > 75k: {income}")

    # More logic and processing can go here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

When you run this code using `streamlit run your_app_filename.py`, it will display a sidebar with all the input fields you've mentioned. After the user provides the input, the provided values will be displayed in the main application window.

This is a basic structure. Based on your project needs, you can expand this to incorporate processing of the input, running machine learning models, displaying results, and more.

## Prompt 06

### Question:

Great! Now change the code so that:

- Use the image in the path './static/images/logo.jpeg'. this image should appear before user input parameters
- For boolean variables: transform values to 0 or 1
- The variables 'HighBP' and 'HighChol' must be inverted, that is, when checked, they must have the value 0
- Build and display a dataframe that has the following columns: 'BMI', 'PhysHlth', 'HighBP_no high BP', 'HighChol_no high cholesterol', 'GenHlth_fair', 'GenHlth_good', 'GenHlth_poor', 'DiffWalk_1.0', 'Income_>75k'. Please present the dataframe in transposed form

### Answer:

Sure! Here's the revised code considering your updates:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

def main():
    st.title("Machine Learning Application")

    # Display the image
    st.image("./static/images/logo.jpeg", use_column_width=True)

    # Collecting inputs from the user
    st.sidebar.header("User Input Parameters")

    # BMI input
    bmi = st.sidebar.slider("BMI", min_value=12.0, max_value=98.0, value=25.0, step=0.1)

    # PhysHlth input
    phys_hlth = st.sidebar.slider("PhysHlth", min_value=0, max_value=30, value=15, step=1)

    # HighBP input
    high_bp = 1 - st.sidebar.checkbox("HighBP")  # Inverted

    # HighChol input
    high_chol = 1 - st.sidebar.checkbox("HighChol")  # Inverted

    # GenHlth input
    gen_hlth_options = ['fair', 'poor', 'good', 'None']
    gen_hlth = st.sidebar.selectbox("GenHlth", options=gen_hlth_options, index=3)
    gen_hlth_fair = 1 if gen_hlth == 'fair' else 0
    gen_hlth_poor = 1 if gen_hlth == 'poor' else 0
    gen_hlth_good = 1 if gen_hlth == 'good' else 0

    # DiffWalk input
    diff_walk = int(st.sidebar.checkbox("DiffWalk"))

    # Income input
    income = int(st.sidebar.checkbox("Income > 75k"))

    # Create DataFrame
    data = {
        'BMI': [bmi],
        'PhysHlth': [phys_hlth],
        'HighBP_no high BP': [high_bp],
        'HighChol_no high cholesterol': [high_chol],
        'GenHlth_fair': [gen_hlth_fair],
        'GenHlth_good': [gen_hlth_good],
        'GenHlth_poor': [gen_hlth_poor],
        'DiffWalk_1.0': [diff_walk],
        'Income_>75k': [income]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Display transposed DataFrame
    st.write(df.T)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The modifications are:

1. Image path is corrected to "./static/images/logo.jpeg".
2. Boolean variables (`HighBP`, `HighChol`, `DiffWalk`, and `Income > 75k`) are converted to integer (`0` or `1`).
3. `HighBP` and `HighChol` checkboxes are still inverted.
4. The DataFrame is constructed and displayed in its transposed form.


## Prompt 07

### Question:

excellent! now you must change the code to perform the following actions:


- read a pickle file 'trained_model.pkl' which is present in the folder './models'
- inform the dataframe for the model
- display a message indicating the prediction, taking into account the threshold of the youden point with the value 0.5022826695304432
- present the probability value in the form of a pie chart (informing the percentage)
- display the shap 'force_plot' graph for the values entered by the user (this is a decision tree model)
- write a message in large red text with the following text 'THIS IS NOT A SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED TOOL! BUILT FOR TEACHING PURPOSES ONLY!``

### Answer:

Alright, let's incorporate these changes step by step.

You'll need to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install shap
```

Here's the modified code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import pickle
import shap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def main():
    st.title("Machine Learning Application")

    # Display the image
    st.image("./static/images/logo.jpeg", use_column_width=True)

    # Load trained model
    with open('./models/trained_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        model = pickle.load(f)

    # Collecting inputs from the user
    st.sidebar.header("User Input Parameters")

    # BMI input
    bmi = st.sidebar.slider("BMI", min_value=12.0, max_value=98.0, value=25.0, step=0.1)

    # ... [All other inputs as in previous code]

    # Create DataFrame
    data = {
        # ... [Same columns and data as in previous code]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Predict probability using model
    probability = model.predict_proba(df)[0][1]
    
    # Determine prediction based on Youden's threshold
    threshold = 0.5022826695304432
    prediction = probability > threshold

    # Display message based on prediction
    if prediction:
        st.write("The prediction is Positive.")
    else:
        st.write("The prediction is Negative.")

    # Display probability as pie chart
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.pie([probability, 1-probability], labels=['Positive', 'Negative'], autopct='%1.2f%%')
    st.pyplot(fig)

    # Display SHAP force plot
    explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(df)
    st_shap = st.pyplot(shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[1], shap_values[1], df, matplotlib=True))

    # Display warning in red
    st.markdown('**THIS IS NOT A SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATED TOOL! BUILT FOR TEACHING PURPOSES ONLY!**', unsafe_allow_html=True, color='red')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Here are the steps added:

1. **Model Loading**: We load the `trained_model.pkl` from the `./models` directory using Python's pickle library.
2. **Prediction**: We use the trained model to obtain the prediction probability for the input data. The decision of whether it's Positive or Negative is determined by comparing the probability to Youden's threshold.
3. **Pie Chart**: We visualize the probability and its complement (i.e., `1 - probability`) as a pie chart using `matplotlib`.
4. **SHAP Force Plot**: We utilize the SHAP library to obtain the SHAP values for the given data and then display the force plot. Please note that if the model you've saved in the pickle file isn't a tree-based model (like XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.), the `TreeExplainer` will not work. Adjust the explainer type accordingly if needed.
5. **Warning Message**: A warning message is displayed in red text.

Make sure you've installed the necessary libraries (`shap`, `matplotlib`, etc.) for this to work.
